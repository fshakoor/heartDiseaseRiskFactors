# Heart-Disease-Risk-Factors
A Python Data Analysis project to investigate various risk factors for heart disease.
This project examines mental health, physical health, sleep deprivation, and BMI as potential risk factors for heart disease. Mental health is the specific focus, hypothesized to be a statistically significant risk factor. Other variables are expected to be reliable risk factors based on established knowledge from organizations like the CDC.
